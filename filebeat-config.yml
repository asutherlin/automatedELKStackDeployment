# * log: Reads every line of the log file (default)
# * stdin: Reads the standard in

#------------------------------ Log input --------------------------------
- type: log

  # Change to true to enable this input configuration.
  enabled: false

  # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
  # To fetch all ".log" files from a specific level of subdirectories

  ### Multiline options

  # Multiline can be used for log messages spanning multiple lines. This is common
  # for Java Stack Traces or C-Line Continuation

  # The regexp Pattern that has to be matched. The example pattern matches all lines starting with [
  #multiline.pattern: ^\[

  # Defines if the pattern set under pattern should be negated or not. Default is false.
  #multiline.negate: false

  # Match can be set to "after" or "before". It is used to define if lines should be append to a pattern
  # that was (not) matched before or after or as long as a pattern is not matched based on negate.
  # Note: After is the equivalent to previous and before is the equivalent to to next in Logstash
  #multiline.match: after

  # The maximum number of lines that are combined to one event.
  # In case there are more the max_lines the additional lines are discarded.
  # Default is 500
  #multiline.max_lines: 500

  # After the defined timeout, an multiline event is sent even if no new pattern was found to start a new event
  # Default is 5s.
  #multiline.timeout: 5s

  # Setting tail_files to true means filebeat starts reading new files at the end
  # instead of the beginning. If this is used in combination with log rotation
  # this can mean that the first entries of a new file are skipped.

  # Backoff values define how aggressively filebeat crawls new files for updates
  # The default values can be used in most cases. Backoff defines how long it is waited
  # to check a file again after EOF is reached. Default is 1s which means the file
  # is checked every second if new lines were added. This leads to a near real time crawling.
  # Every time a new line appears, backoff is reset to the initial value.
  #backoff: 1s

  # Max backoff defines what the maximum backoff time is. After having backed off multiple times
  # from checking the files, the waiting time will never exceed max_backoff independent of the
  # backoff factor. Having it set to 10s means in the worst case a new line can be added to a log
  # file after having backed off multiple times, it takes a maximum of 10s to read the new line
  #max_backoff: 10s

  # The backoff factor defines how fast the algorithm backs off. The bigger the backoff factor,
  # the faster the max_backoff value is reached. If this value is set to 1, no backoff will happen.
  # The backoff value will be multiplied each time with the backoff_factor until max_backoff is reached
  #backoff_factor: 2

  # Max number of harvesters that are started in parallel.
  # Default is 0 which means unlimited
  #harvester_limit: 0

  # any more. In case the file shows up again later, harvesting will continue at the last known position
  # after scan_frequency.
  #close_removed: true

  # By default this is disabled.

  #clean_removed: true

#================================ Processors ===================================

# Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to
# enhance the event with external metadata. This section defines a list of
# processors that are applied one by one and the first one receives the initial
# event:
#
#   event -> filter1 -> event1 -> filter2 ->event2 ...
#
# The supported processors are drop_fields, drop_event, include_fields,
# decode_json_fields, and add_cloud_metadata.
#
# For example, you can use the following processors to keep the fields that
# contain CPU load percentages, but remove the fields that contain CPU ticks
# values:
#
#processors:
#- include_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu"]
#- drop_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu.user", "cpu.system"]
#
# The following example drops the events that have the HTTP response code 200:
#
#processors:
#- drop_event:
#    when:
#       equals:
#           http.code: 200
#
# The following example renames the field a to b:
#
#processors:
#- rename:
#    fields:
#       - from: "a"
#         to: "b"
#
# The following example tokenizes the string into fields:
#
#processors:
#- dissect:
#    tokenizer: "%{key1} - %{key2}"
#    field: "message"
#    target_prefix: "dissect"
#
# The following example enriches each event with metadata from the cloud
# provider about the host machine. It works on EC2, GCE, DigitalOcean,
# Tencent Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.
#
#processors:
#- add_cloud_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with the machine's local time zone
# offset from UTC.
#
#processors:
#- add_locale:
#    format: offset
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# given fields to an existing container id and adds info from that container:
#
#processors:
#- add_docker_metadata:
#    host: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
#    match_fields: ["system.process.cgroup.id"]
#    match_pids: ["process.pid", "process.ppid"]
#    match_source: true
#    match_source_index: 4
#    match_short_id: false
#    cleanup_timeout: 60

#    #  key:                   "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# container id from log path available in `source` field (by default it expects
# it to be /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log).
#
#processors:
#- add_docker_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with host metadata.
#
#processors:
#- add_host_metadata:
#   netinfo.enabled: false
#
# The following example enriches each event with process metadata using
# process IDs included in the event.
#
#processors:
#- add_process_metadata:
#    match_pids: ["system.process.ppid"]
#    target: system.process.parent
#
# The following example decodes fields containing JSON strings
# and replaces the strings with valid JSON objects.
#
#processors:
#- decode_json_fields:
#    fields: ["field1", "field2", ...]
#    process_array: false
#    max_depth: 1
#    target: ""
#    overwrite_keys: false
#
#processors:
#- decompress_gzip_field:
#    from: "field1"
#    to: "field2"
#    ignore_missing: false
#    fail_on_error: true
#
# The following example copies the value of message to message_copied
#
#processors:
#- copy_fields:
#    fields:
#        - from: message
#          to: message_copied
#    fail_on_error: true
#    ignore_missing: false
#
# The following example truncates the value of message to 1024 bytes
#
#processors:
#- truncate_fields:
#    fields:
#      - message
#    max_bytes: 1024
#    fail_on_error: false
#    ignore_missing: true
#
# The following example preserves the raw message under event.original
#
#processors:
#- copy_fields:
#    fields:
#        - from: message
#          to: event.original
#    fail_on_error: false
#    ignore_missing: true
#- truncate_fields:
